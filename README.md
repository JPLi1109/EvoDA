This repository contains the code for our paper "Evolving Domain Adaptation for Generalizable EEG Emotion Recognition".

Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition is an important method for diagnosing and rehabilitating psychiatric disorders such as depression, providing high accuracy and objectivity. However, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals causes distribution shifts over time, leading to significant performance degradation in dynamic environments. Existing domain adaptation (DA) methods address this issue but rely on large target datasets for calibration, restricting their use to offline settings and limiting real-time clinical applications. To overcome these limitations, we propose Evolving Domain Adaptation (EvoDA), an innovative online adaptive framework designed specifically for EEG data. EvoDA employs a two-stage generalization process that synergizes the rapid adaptation capabilities of few-shot generalization with distribution alignment, ensuring dynamic responsiveness to evolving EEG data. During training, a robust meta-learning model is developed to ensure broad generalization across diverse data distributions. In the testing phase, an evolvable meta-adaptation module dynamically aligns the marginal distribution of incoming target data with the evolving source data within a model-agnostic meta-learning framework. This approach enables the model to effectively capture and adapt to shifting data trends, thereby enhancing performance in real-time scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoDA significantly outperforms existing few-shot and online adaptation algorithms, showcasing its superior adaptability and robustness.
